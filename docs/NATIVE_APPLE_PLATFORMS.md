# Native Apple-platform expansion

## Baseline and current milestone

The frozen iOS base is `9abdd5e8150b47fc176d203db23db10854c81188`. Work is isolated on `codex/apple-platforms`; the iOS modernization branch is unchanged. This milestone implements a separate native macOS executable, `QRCatcherMac`, with the original `100mango.QRCatcher` identity. It is not a Catalyst or iPhone compatibility build. iPad, Watch, TV and Vision work remains staged; this document does not claim they are implemented.

Mac deployment floor is 13.0. Build verification covers both arm64 and x86_64; runtime XCTest proof must be reported separately for each executed architecture. A compile is not runtime proof. All builds here are unsigned and no Store records, signing resources or persistent capabilities are created.

## Product workflow

- Open an image with the native file panel, select an image from Photos, drop an image/file, or paste an image from the clipboard
- Decode real pixels locally using the shared Core Image QR decoder, normalize EXIF orientation at the ImageIO boundary, and display a result without opening anything automatically
- Save every decoded result in local history, preserve existing duplicate semantics, search/select history, and copy a result
- Open only explicitly chosen HTTP/HTTPS links without embedded credentials in the system browser
- Export a real rescannable PNG with a four-module quiet zone, or export all history as versioned JSON with original timestamps and order
- Reopen the app and read persisted history; failed store loads retain the original bytes and still allow scan/copy/export of a current result
- Choose an available desktop camera, request camera access, decode bounded real video frames and stop after a result. Absence, denial, interruptions and connection changes are explicit, with import fallback and retry

Mac history lives in the Mac's Application Support/100mango.QRCatcher/coredata.sqlite. Phone history remains at its existing Documents/coredata.sqlite. No automatic transfer, account, backend or sync is introduced. The original QR.xcdatamodeld, URLEntity and storage adapter implementation are unchanged. The shared domain value projection is Foundation-only. The UIKit codec is a thin adapter over the extracted Core Graphics/Core Image implementation.

## Test contract

Run `python3 scripts/materialize_qr_fixtures.py` before opening/building the project. The independent checked-in fixtures use ReportLab QR encoding, include ASCII/Unicode/rotated/multiple/invalid input, and verify their recorded SHA-256. Rebuilding fixtures is an intentional development step; production never uses them.

Run `python3 scripts/generate_project.py` after changing source inventory. The generated Xcode project is deterministic and CI rejects a difference.

The `Native Apple platforms` workflow has one public `xcode-27` job with bounded execution and evidence output. It checks exact source/tree/toolchain, unsigned universal Mac Release, DEBUG hook exclusion, Mac unit/UI XCTest, unsigned iOS Release, original model/store preservation and iOS unit/codec-equivalence regression. It exports only bounded synthetic screenshots after XCTest and logs each screenshot's SHA-256 before transfer.

Native UI test import and export use actual NSOpenPanel/NSSavePanel; decoding, storage and exports are production code. The only DEBUG test hook chooses an isolated store path. No real user store is deleted, TCC database is altered or OS security prompt bypassed.

Physical camera capture/denial/disconnect, Photos-account integration, oldest supported OS launch, x86_64 runtime, signed sandbox and distribution remain separately recorded gates unless concrete evidence is later supplied. No App Store accessibility/privacy compatibility claims follow merely from these tests.
